        <p>GEM is a private space for close friend groups — no public feeds, no strangers. Here's how to go from zero to planning in a few minutes.</p>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Step 1 — Join a group</p>
        <p className="mt-1">If a friend invited you, tap the invite link they shared or open GEM, tap <strong>Join a Group</strong>, and enter the invite code. You'll be added as a member instantly.</p>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Step 2 — Or create your own group</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 mt-1">
          <li>Tap <strong>Create a Group</strong> from the home screen.</li>
          <li>Give your group a name (e.g. "The Crew" or "Book Club").</li>
          <li>Copy the invite link or code and share it with your friends.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Step 3 — Explore your group</p>
        <p className="mt-1">Once you're in a group you'll see three tabs: <strong>Events</strong>, <strong>Channels</strong>, and <strong>Members</strong>. Create an event, join a channel, or invite more people from the Members tab.</p>

        <p>Events are the core of Gem — a place to coordinate plans, collect RSVPs, and keep the conversation in one spot.</p>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Creating an event</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 mt-1">
          <li>Open your group and go to the <strong>Events</strong> tab.</li>
          <li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top right.</li>
          <li>Fill in a name, date, time, and optional location or description.</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>Create</strong>. All group members will see the event immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">RSVPs</p>
        <p className="mt-1">Open an event and tap <strong>Going</strong>, <strong>Maybe</strong>, or <strong>Not going</strong>. You can change your RSVP at any time. Admins can see a full RSVP list from the event page.</p>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Event chat</p>
        <p className="mt-1">Each event has its own chat thread. Use it to share details, directions, or last-minute changes — it stays attached to the event so nothing gets lost.</p>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Legendary events</p>
        <p className="mt-1">Admins can mark special events as <strong>Legendary</strong>. These are highlighted in the events list and preserved as group memories.</p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-gray-500 text-xs">Events sync to your calendar app via ICS — see <em>Subscribe your calendar to a group</em> for setup instructions.</p>

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Channels</p>
        <p className="mt-1">Channels live in your group's <strong>Channels</strong> tab. They're great for ongoing conversations — #general, #planning, #random. Join any open channel by tapping <strong>Join</strong>. Admins can create new channels and make them invite-only if needed.</p>
        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200 mt-3">Event chat</p>
        <p className="mt-1">Open any event and scroll down to find its chat thread. This is the best place for event-specific coordination.</p>

          <li>Tap and hold (or swipe right on mobile) to react, reply, pin, edit, or delete a message.</li>
          <li>Inline replies quote the original message so threads stay clear.</li>
          <li>Pinned messages appear at the top of the channel.</li>
